# BaumBauen

> This is where we really bauen the Baums

This is the code for the paper [Learning tree structures from leaves for particle decay reconstruction](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ac8de0).

The dataset used in the study is [available on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6983258).


## Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. Create a Python virtual environment for the project:
   ```
   python3 -m venv /path/to/baum-env
   ```
2. Activate the new environment with
   ```
   source /path/to/baum-env/bin/activate
   ```
3. The first time you'll need to update pip:
   ```
   pip3 install -U pip
   ```
4. Install the `baumbauen` package  with:
   ```
   cd /path/to/baumbauen/repo
   pip install .
   ```
   or if you're doing development work and want code changes to be reflected in the installed package immediately:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```
5. (Optional) If you'd like to run the package tests then install `pytest`:
   ```
	 pip install pytest pytest-cov
	 ```


## Usage

There are two ways to see usage of the package: the examples in the [scripts](scripts/README.md) and [notebooks](notebooks) folders.

The scripts are for executing in a grid/batch environment, this includes `basf2` steering files (requires Belle II software) as well as PyTorch training scripts.

The notebooks are self-contained and are ordered according to workflow by their numbering (lettering indicates author).
They do require [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to be able to read/commit notebooks (installed as a requirement for BaumBauen).
When opening notebooks select `File > Jupytext > Pair Notebook with light Script`
